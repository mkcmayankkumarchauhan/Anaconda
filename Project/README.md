Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

Python: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to analyze the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
Pandas Library: This was used to analyze the data.
Matplotlib Library: I visualized the data.
Seaborn Library: Helped me create more advanced visuals.
Jupyter Notebooks: The tool I used to run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
Visual Studio Code: My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
